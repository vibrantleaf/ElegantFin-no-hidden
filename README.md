### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting 
<details>
  <summary>1Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>How do I check if I am using the latest version on ElegantFin-no-hidden?</i></summary>

- To make sure that you are using the latest version of ElegantFin-no-hidden, check the version number at the bottom in the Dashboard screen. 
- It should be something like ElegantFin-no-hidden v25.01.XX

  <summary>2Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>I see that a newer version is available, but I have not received it yet. Why?</i></summary>

- If Dashboard footer shows an old version, it means that your app is still using an old cache.
- Once that cache is updated, the new version will be loaded. 
- To get the latest version, you will need to clear cache. There are multiple ways to do it.
- On web version, force a hard refresh of the page using CTRL + F5.
- On apps, try signing out and back in again. OR in case of Jellyfin Media Player on windows, you might need to delete the cache folder. That should definitely pull the latest version.

  <summary>3Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>Why do I notice visual bugs and inconsistencies on Jellyfin Media Player?</i></summary>

- Currently JMP uses Qt 5.x which uses an outdated web engine, so many new CSS features do not work. Once they release a new version based on Qt 6.x, most issues should automatically be resolved. Until then, I advise using the web app instead.
- Are you not using JMP and still facing issues? See the 4th point below.
